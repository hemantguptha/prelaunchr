    <p>Thanks for signing up!</p>

    <p>Now you can simply dial our number and get a car mechanic delivered straight to your home! (Its sometimes faster than pizza!)</p>

    <p><strong>Why we came up with Garagely?</strong></p>

    <p>Shhh…that’s a secret. And it's a major one, keep reading to find it out.</p>

    <p>Enjoy flawless service, awesome pricing and put that time instead into doing what you love!</p>

    <p>We are REALLY excited to bring this to you.</p>

    <p>Now before you reach for a slice of this delicious cake, we'd like to know a few things from you.<br/><br/>

    1) Where are you from? Tell us something cool about yourself <br/>

    2) Where do you work? What kinda car do you drive?<br/>

    3) What is it that inspires you the most in your life?<br/><br/>

    and the most important question<br/><br/>

    4) If money were no object what would you do in life?</p>

    <p>Looking forward to hear from you.</p>

    <p>PS: Oh and it's no big secret really. We all like to rest our lazy butts on the couch and watch TV while getting stuff done.</p>
    <p>PPS: Spread this url and ask friends to sign up to get discount: http://<%= Rails.application.config.action_mailer.default_url_options[:host] %>/?ref=<%= CGI::escape(@user.referral_code) %></p>

    <p>Thanks <br/>
